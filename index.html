<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I am Amitabh Sharma, an MS by Research student at the Robotics Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad. My work focuses on adaptive and impedance control for robotic systems that interact dynamically with the environment, with an emphasis on aerial manipulation. I combine Lyapunov-based stability analysis with full-stack experiments across ROS/ROS 2, PX4, Gazebo, and Isaac Sim to move controllers from simulation to hardware with formal guarantees on robustness and performance.
</p>

<h2>Research Focus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Adaptive impedance control for compliant aerial manipulation under unknown vehicle-arm coupling</li>
  <li>Integrated grasp-and-flight with bistable grippers and adaptive control</li>
  <li>Fault-tolerant control for quadrotors under actuator loss and state-dependent disturbances</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selected Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Adaptive Impedance Control for Aerial Manipulation — uniformly ultimately bounded tracking and impedance errors under unknown coupling.</li>
  <li>Integrated Aerial Grasping — bistable gripper with adaptive control for robust grasp-and-flight.</li>
  <li>Fault-Tolerant Quadrotor Control — handles actuator loss and state-dependent disturbances.</li>
</ul>
